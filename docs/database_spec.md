# Database Specification

This document specifies the schema of the `hymns.sqlite` database and provides guidance on how it's used within the application.

## Application-Level Concepts

- **Hymn ID**: A string that uniquely identifies a hymn, composed of a `HymnGroup` prefix and a number (e.g., "E1", "C215"). This ID is the primary key in the `hymns` table.
- **HymnGroup**: A high-level categorization of hymns, typically by language or collection. The `HymnsActivity` uses this to manage which hymn book is currently active. The available hymn groups are defined in the `HymnGroup.java` enum.
- **Parent Hymn**: A data inheritance mechanism that allows a "child" hymn to inherit data from a "parent" hymn. This is implemented in the `HymnsDao.java` file and is used to avoid data duplication. When a hymn is loaded, the DAO checks for a `parent_hymn` and merges the data, with the child's data taking precedence. For example, if a Tagalog hymn has an English parent, it can inherit the composer, meter, and tune, while still providing its own Tagalog stanzas.
- **Related Hymn**: A system for linking different versions of the same hymn across various hymn groups (usually languages). The `related` column in the `hymns` table stores a comma-separated list of other hymn IDs. This allows the app to find and display hymns with the same tune in different languages, creating a web of connections between hymn translations.

## How to Query

**Important Note on Character Encoding:** The database contains text with special characters (e.g., accented letters, curly apostrophes). When querying the database and exporting data to files (like CSV), it is crucial to use **UTF-8 encoding** to prevent character corruption. Failure to do so will result in characters being replaced by placeholders like `?`.

The database can be queried using the `sqlite3.exe` command-line tool located in the `sqlite` directory of this workspace.

### Example Queries

**Get a hymn by its ID:**

```shell
c:\dev\hymnsforandroid\sqlite\sqlite3.exe c:\dev\hymnsforandroid\app\src\main\assets\hymns.sqlite "SELECT * FROM hymns WHERE _id='E1'"
```

**Get the stanzas for a hymn:**

```shell
c:\dev\hymnsforandroid\sqlite\sqlite3.exe c:\dev\hymnsforandroid\app\src\main\assets\hymns.sqlite "SELECT * FROM stanza WHERE parent_hymn='E1'"
```
